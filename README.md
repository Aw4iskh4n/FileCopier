# FileCopier
FileCopier is a simple Python utility for copying files from a source directory to a destination directory. It handles files in nested subdirectories and ensures that no files are overwritten in the destination directory. If a file with the same name already exists, FileCopier renames the new file to maintain uniqueness.
